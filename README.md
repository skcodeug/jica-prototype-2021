  <p align="center">LAWS API is prototype for accessing <a href="https://github.com/skcodeug/jica-prototype-2021.git" target="blank">Laws</a>.</p>
    
## Description

In the wake of the waning off pandemic of COVID-19; it has become more important than ever to have a legal framework through which controls and reviews can be implemented. This prototype seeks to show an access criteria of laws which can be expanded upon to the level of desired detail for whatever  purpose it is put through.

Information which is technically processed data; can be consumed from a variety of interfaces: web, mobile, tablet plus upcoming interfaces like watches & glasses. __Therefore this prototype is limited to an API to focus on availing information that can be consumed on any interface. *The UI can always be built to suit a user's specific need.*__

For purposes of versatility, only one model has been demonstrated; otherwise the application will flow to suit the final design.
